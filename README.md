Improvements to that I'd like to make if I had more time:
* revise and add more proper selectors
* add a CI/CD yaml to hook it up to a pipeline
* dockerize this solution to make it platform-agnostic
* improve reporting by adding more reporting types
* extend the POM for better suiting the needs
* add more web drivers to diversify cross-browser testing
* add a visual testing plugin to be able to compare screenshots
* add a linter and agree on common conventions
* fine-tune and tweak the WebDriver IO config file to better suite the project needs
